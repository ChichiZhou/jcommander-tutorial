Covers how to parse your Java command line arguments quickly with the JCommander API 

This tutorial overs how to parse your Java command line arguments super fast by using a declarative approach (via annotations).

I cover the majority of features one would like to adopt for every project requiring parsing the CLI such as help, usage, validators, type converters, required parameters, descriptions, multiple names, separators, arity (multiple values) and reading the parameters from  file.

This small framework is a real time saver, quick to learn and a tool
you should definitely include in your tool box.
